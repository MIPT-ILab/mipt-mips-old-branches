Author: Alexander Pronin <alexander.pronin.mipt@gmail.com>

04/02/15 16:39 version 1.0:

Start working with project. Created new objects:
- perf_sim.cpp
- perf_sim.h
- Makefile
- main.cpp

Changes in perf_sim.h and perf_sim.cpp:
- added some functions for implementation
- main functions haven't been implemented yet

The task hasn't been done yet. Program doesn't work because of it.



04/03/15 02:39 version 1.1:

Continue working with project. Created new object:
- rf.h

Changes in perf_sim.h:
- added some functions for implementation
- main functions haven't been implemented yet

Changes in rf.h:
- main idea was taken from func_sim register file
- it is ready to work

The task hasn't been done yet. Program doesn't work because of it.



04/05/15 03:27 version 1.2:

The task is almost complete.

Changes in perf_sim.h and perf_sim.cpp:
- added comments
- added implementations of pipeline blocks

Changes in rf.h:
- added comments

Changes in main.cpp:
- added support of -d key

Changes in func_instr.h:
- found bug which didn't allow us to use copy constructor

Changes in Makefile:
- renamed main file to perf_sim

Program is working, but it hasn't been checked by valgrind.



04/05/15 4:15 version 1.3:

The task is complete.

Changes in main.cpp:
- fixed memory leak

Program is working. It also has small memory leaks connected with ports.h library.
I will try to fix them if I have enough time.
