[branch] The final commit of the first assignment. However the tests are not completed in the auto mode, they all work almost properly, except the distruction process, as I wrote: the test prints: segmentation fault. But at the same time both: the test with blocked destructor of FuncMemory and main program work properly. What's more, according to valgrind, the only memory, which is not cleanered after the main program: the memory, allocated in getAllElfSections function, and I can't influance it without rewriting this function. And, as I suppose segmentation fault appeares because of 'Conditional jump ore move depends on uninitialised value(s)', as valgrind reports. But as I see it occurs when I check if the pointer is NULL. So that's quite strange reaction. But maybe I don't understand something. Sorry for such a long commit message"
